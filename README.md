# Patika Store Stock System

This project is a simple console-based inventory management system for a store, specifically designed as an assignment project. It manages two types of products: notebooks and phones. The system allows the user to add, delete, and list products, as well as view available brands.

## Functionality

### Main Menu

Upon running the application, the main menu provides the following options:

1. **Notebooks**: Manage notebook inventory.
2. **Phones**: Manage phone inventory.
3. **List all brands**: Display all available brands.
4. **Exit**: Exit the application.

### Notebook and Phone Operations

Both notebooks and phones have similar management options:

1. **Add**: Add a new product to the inventory.
2. **Delete**: Remove a product from the inventory.
3. **List all**: Display all products of the selected type.
4. **Exit**: Return to the main menu.

### Adding a Product

When adding a product, the user is prompted to enter details such as ID, price, discount rate, stock amount, name, brand ID, storage, screen size, and RAM. For phones, additional information like battery capacity and color is required.

### Deleting a Product

When deleting a product, the user is prompted to enter the ID of the product to be removed. The system will display a message confirming the removal.

### Listing Products and Brands

The system displays all products of the selected type (notebooks or phones) and all available brands.
